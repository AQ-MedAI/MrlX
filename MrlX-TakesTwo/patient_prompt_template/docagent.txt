You are evaluating the quality of a patient’s simulated responses during a medical consultation.
Original self-report: {self report}
Diagnosis: {diagnosis}
Recommendation: {recommendation}
Doctor’s questions and simulated patient answers: {simulated dialogue}
Instructions:
1. Information Control Rate (0-1):
- Check whether the patient’s answers include extra information not asked by the doctor.
- Deduct 20% for each extra information point.
- Score = max(0, 1 - 0.2 × number of extra points)
2. Response Completeness Rate (0-1):
- Check whether the patient answered all points asked by the doctor.
- Deduct 20% for each missing information point.
- Score = max(0, 1 - 0.2 × number of missing points)
3. Factual Conflict Rate (0-1):
- Check if the patient’s response is completely opposite to the original selfreport.
- Increase 20% for each completely opposite found.
- Score = min(1, 1 - 0.2 × number of opposite)
