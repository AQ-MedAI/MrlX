{"question": "What is the Pythagorean theorem?", "answer": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. It is expressed as a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides."}
{"question": "Describe the water cycle.", "answer": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. It involves four main stages: evaporation (water turns into vapor), condensation (vapor forms clouds), precipitation (rain, snow, or hail falls), and collection (water gathers in oceans, rivers, and lakes). This cycle repeats continuously, driven by the sun's energy."}
{"question": "What are the primary colors?", "answer": "The primary colors depend on the color system. In additive color (light), the primary colors are red, green, and blue (RGB). In subtractive color (pigments), the primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). In traditional art, red, yellow, and blue are often taught as primary colors."}
{"question": "Explain Newton's first law of motion.", "answer": "Newton's first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. This means objects resist changes to their state of motion."}
{"question": "What is DNA and what does it do?", "answer": "DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a molecule that carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, and reproduction of all living organisms. It has a double helix structure and contains genes that determine inherited traits. DNA stores and transmits genetic information from parents to offspring and guides protein synthesis in cells."}
