{"question": "Explain the concept of machine learning in simple terms.", "answer": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following rigid instructions, machine learning systems identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions."}
{"question": "What are the three states of matter?", "answer": "The three fundamental states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. In a solid, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in fixed positions. In a liquid, particles are loosely connected and can flow. In a gas, particles move freely and spread out to fill their container."}
{"question": "How does photosynthesis work?", "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Plants absorb sunlight using chlorophyll, take in carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil. Through a series of chemical reactions, they produce glucose (sugar) for energy and release oxygen as a byproduct."}
{"question": "What is the difference between RAM and ROM?", "answer": "RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory used for temporary storage while a computer is running. It loses data when power is turned off. ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile memory that permanently stores essential system instructions and doesn't lose data when powered off. RAM is much faster and used for active tasks, while ROM typically stores firmware and boot instructions."}
